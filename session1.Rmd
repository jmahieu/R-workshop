## Preparation
Download the "Red Wine Quality" Data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x7hr7a786no4x14/winequality-red.csv?dl=1) and save it in a local folder. This is the data we are going to use in the sessions. For more details about the dataset, consult the [original publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub)

Install the **tidyverse** and **stargazer** packages by typing the following code in the `RStudio` Console: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("stargazer")
#you could do this also in one line of code:
#install.packages(c("tidyverse", "stargazer"))
```
